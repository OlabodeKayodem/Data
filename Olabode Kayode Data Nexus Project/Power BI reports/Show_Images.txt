**Here are the steps to make sure the images show on VSCODE**

Step 1: When you have downloaded the Jupyter file and opened it on VSCODE,

Step 2: Create a markdown cell, not code.

Step 3: Write the code below into the markdown cell you created to show the images:


**Connecting to the database**
![Connecting the database](C.jpg)

**Checking for the False**
![Checking for the False](B.jpg)

**Checking for the False**
![Checking for the False](A.jpg)

Step 4: Make sure the images and the Jupyter code are in the same folder.


Step 5: After completing the above steps, run all the cells again to ensure that the images are displayed correctly.
